# UFOS
## Purpose
The Purpose of this project is to learn how to extract data from an array in the javascript array and create a table that adjusts according to real time updates to the array.

## Background
Are we alone in this universe? UFO sightings have been an obsession among many for centuries. Are they real or some government conspiracy? We have been tasked to help Dana with building a webpage in which others can access information of reported sightings and see for themselves. This webpage should include:

A description or summary of the topic
A table to display all of the information from the data source
Search filters that will allow for visitors to update the table based on the search criteria they enter.

## Results
The ufo page UFO sightings- The truth is out was created and this is the first look of the page.
